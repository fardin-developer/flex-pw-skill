Difference Between Grid and Flexbox:

1. Dimensionality and Flexibility:

Flexbox offers greater control over alignment and space distribution between items. Being one-dimensional, Flexbox only deals with either columns or rows.
Grid has two-dimension layout capabilities which allow flexible widths as a unit of length. This compensates for the limitations in Flex.
2. Alignment:

Flex Direction allows developers to align elements vertically or horizontally, which is used when developers create and reverse rows or columns.
CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality to automatically adjust columns or rows.
3. Item Management

Flex Container is the parent element while Flex Item represents the children. The Flex Container can ensure balanced representation by adjusting item dimensions. This allows developers to design for fluctuating screen sizes.
Grid supports both implicit and explicit content placement. Its inbuilt automation allows it to automatically extend line items and copy values into the new creation from the preceding item.
